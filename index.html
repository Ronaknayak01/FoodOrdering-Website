                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Food Catering</h2>
                <p class="center">Catering is the business of providing food service at a remote site or a site such as a hotel, hospital, pub, aircraft, cruise ship, park, festival, filming location or film studio. A caterer provides, transports, and prepares food for clients, particularly for special events such as conferences, weddings, celebrations, or large gatherings. Responsibilities may include not only providing and preparing food but also serving it and cleaning up afterwards.  The taste of the food is what brings people back, not necessarily the price.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Bulk foods may be priced less compared to packaged foods because they are typically packaged in large generic bulk containers and packaging for grocery outlets, which utilizes lesser natural resources. Additionally, less packaging is congruent with the environmental conservation of natural resources and sustainability.
                    Bulk foods are food items offered in large quantities, which can be purchased in large, bulk lots or transferred from a bulk container into a smaller container for purchase.
